# F4D (Fluka for Docker)

V. Boccone, A. Fontana, D. HorvÃ¡th

These scripts allow to install and run Fluka and Flair inside a Docker container in any OS where Docker can be installed. The idea is derived by the scripts developed and maintained by V. Boccone at https://github.com/drbokko/fedora_27-fluka

# Installing Docker

You can install Docker in the host OS by following the instructions on the Docker website: these are available for the most common Linux flavours, Windows 10 (Home and Professional Editions) and MacOS.

## OS X, Linux, Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education

Install Docker Community Edition: https://www.docker.com/community-edition

## Windows 10 Home (and possibly older Windows versions)

Install Docker Toolbox: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/

Windows 10 Home does not enable Hyper-V, which is required for Docker Community Edition. Docker Toolbox provides a workaround. This is not optimal for performance, but it allows to run FLUKA also on Windows 10 Home.

## Post installation steps for both Windows 10 versions

Install Public Domain Release version of Xming (http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/).

Allow Docker and Xming through the firewall.

## Additional info for Linux

Once docker is installed you need to add your user to the docker group.   
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

In this way, all docker commands can be issued as $USER.

## Testing Docker installation

To check if the installation of Docker was successful, run the following command: ```docker run --rm hello-world```

If everything is correct, you should see following message:
```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

# Generating your personal docker image with Fluka

The scripts for the generation of a basic Fluka-compatible image are open source.

## Getting the scripts

### Download

You can download the latest version of the scripts from the github repository:   
[https://github.com/flukadocker/F4D/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/flukadocker/F4D/archive/master.zip)

### Git clone

You can alternatively checkout the full repository with the scripts from the github repository:   
```
git clone https://github.com/flukadocker/F4D.git
```
In both cases the download directory is your choice.

## Making the docker directory

### OS X, Linux

The downloaded scripts can be placed anywhere in your home directory.

### Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education

Create a folder on the ```C:\``` drive (e.g. ```C:\docker```) and copy every folder and file from the zip file (repository) there.

### Windows 10 Home (and possibly older Windows versions)

Create the specific folder ```C:\Users\docker``` and copy every folder and file from the zip file (repository) there.

## Running the installation script

### OS X, Linux

You can generate your personal Fluka image by running in a terminal the ```install_linux.sh``` script in the root of the repository.

### Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education

Execute in a Windows prompt terminal or by double-clicking on it the script ```install_win.bat```.

### Windows 10 Home (and possibly older Windows versions)

Start as Administrator a Docker Quickstart Terminal and execute from the directory ```/c/Users/docker``` the script ```install_win10.bat```. This script will install the necessary start the Docker container with Fluka and Flair installed and ready to be used.

Alternatively you can start the Docker Quickstart Terminal as Administrator and execute the install script in a Windows prompt terminal also started as Administrator.

## The installation process

Both install scripts will prompt for your Fluka credentials (fuid-xxxx and password), download the latest public Fluka release and install it in a Fedora based Docker container.

The installation might require a bit of time - from 1 to 10 minutes - depending on the speed of your internet connection.

The typical output of these steps in all systems is as follows:
```

During this phase the script will:
- download the necessary base image from the docker hub to the local docker image repository;
- download and install Flair;
- download Fluka from [fluka.org](http://fluka.org) using your *fuid* and *password*;
- perform the necessary Fluka installation steps;
- create a *fluka* default user in the image.

## Custom packages

It is possible to install additional fedora packages. Uncomment and edit the appropriate lines in ```./common/flair.dockerfile```. Multiple packages can be listed, the package names should be separated with ```SPACE```.

After editing the dockerfile, run the installation script again to create the image with the custom packages.

# Your first Fluka container

## Creating a container

### OS X, Linux

It is possible to get a shell terminal to container and to pass trough the X11 connection along with some local folder.

Execute from a terminal ```./run_linux.sh```: this script will start the Docker container with Fluka and Flair installed.

Note: Depending on your Xserver configuration you might need to run:
```
xhost +
```
 on the host OS to enable the running the X11 forwarding.

### Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, and Education

Use XLaunch to start Xming without access control.

Change directory to where you have installed the Docker scripts (e.g. ```C:\docker```) and execute the script ```run_win10_professional.bat```: this script will start the Docker container with Fluka and Flair installed.

Allow sharing the ```C:\``` drive, if Docker asks.

### Windows 10 Home (and possibly older Windows versions)

Use XLaunch to start Xming without access control.

Start as Administrator a Docker Quickstart Terminal and execute from the directory ```/c/Users/docker``` the script ```run_win10_home.bat```. This script will start the Docker container with Fluka and Flair installed and ready to be used.

Alternatively you can execute it in a Windows prompt terminal (started as Administrator).

## Using a container

Once in the docker container shell you could use the shell as if you would on a normal linux system.

The container automatically starts in the ```/docker_work``` folder. This folder is shared folder between the host OS and the Docker container. On the host OS it's located in the user-defined directory (e.g. ```C:\docker``` or ```C:\Users\docker```) as a subfolder.

You can try, for example, to run Fluka by:
```
[flukauser@linuxkit-025000000001 docker_work]$ mkdir test
[flukauser@linuxkit-025000000001 docker_work]$ cd test
[flukauser@linuxkit-025000000001 test]$ cp $FLUPRO/example.inp .
[flukauser@linuxkit-025000000001 test]$ $FLUPRO/flutil/rfluka -N0 -M1 example
$TARGET_MACHINE = Linux
$FLUPRO = /usr/local/fluka

     Moving fort.51 to /docker_work/test/example001_fort.51
End of FLUKA run
```

or also running Flair with the command ```flair```.

Always work in the ```/docker_work``` directory. While the home folder ```~``` is saved between sessions, it is not shared with the host OS.

### Limitation of parallel jobs

On Windows by default Docker is configured to have limited CPU cores and memory available to the containers. Only run one simulation job at a time. Parallel jobs might cause errors or hang the container.

## Stopping a container

Use the ```exit``` command in the container's shell to stop it.

# Updating the Fluka docker image

If a new version of Fluka or Flair released, you can update your Fluka docker image by running the installation script again. It will automatically download and install the updated versions.

## Errors during update

In case of an error during the update you can try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Check your internet connection, and see if [fluka.org](http://fluka.org) can be loaded.

3. Delete the ```fluka*.tar.gz``` file in the scripts folder.

3. Delete all in you Docker directory and redownload the latest scripts.

# More information on Docker in general

## Working with containers

Working with containers might not be so easy if are not used to the Command Line Interface in Linux. [Digital Ocean provides a nice primer](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/working-with-docker-containers)

Each container instance is identified by an unique CONTAINER ID code and an unique name. If no name is specified during the container creation docker will generate a random name.

If you are working in an interactive container you can terminate the shell by typing exit. If no ```--rm``` option was specified at the container instantiation the status container will not be lost and will be saved on the system.

The list of the instantiated container (and their status) can be obtained by the following command:
```
docker ps -a
```

An *Exited* container can be restarted with:
```
docker start <CONTAINER ID> or <CONTAINER NAME>
```

An *Running* but detached container can be reattached by:
```
docker attach <CONTAINER ID> or <CONTAINER NAME>
```
